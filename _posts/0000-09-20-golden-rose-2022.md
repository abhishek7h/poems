he embarked to

the garden of a thousand roses

to get the golden rose
\
\
determined to obtain

the golden rose

he handled adversity
\
\
reaching the garden

after hours

he has spotted the rose
\
\
blood shed

pain endured

he has the golden rose
\
\
for he promised someone

who he loved

more than life itself

"for you, a thousand times over", he enunciated
