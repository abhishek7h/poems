The best will eventually wear out
And occur will a drought
Of happiness and hate
Because when someone so great
Has finally fell
The world will mourn well.

But one day without doubt
A seed will surely sprout
From the dead's ashes
Like a phoenix, it dashes
Through the sky
Making everyone cry
Not tears of pain
But Tears of joy that rain.

For, the next generation is here
Please don't shed a tear
They will thrive
With their drive
They will be the successor
To their predecessor.
