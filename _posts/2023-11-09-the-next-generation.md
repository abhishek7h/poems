The best will eventually wear out

And occur will a drought

Of happiness and hate

Because when someone so great

Has finally fell

The world will mourn well.
\
\
But one day without doubt

A seed will surely sprout

From the dead's ashes

Like a phoenix, it dashes

Through the sky

Making everyone cry

Not tears of pain

But Tears of joy that rain.
\
\
For, the next generation is here

Please don't shed a tear

They will thrive

With their drive

They will be the successor

To their predecessor.
