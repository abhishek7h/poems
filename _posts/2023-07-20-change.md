title: Change

We all must change, we ought to change

Like caterpillars, becoming butterflies

Metamorphosis.
\
\
We see ourselves change

We notice the differences

Of who we were, and who we are.
\
\
We must prosper and choose the path of good

The path of evil is tempting

For 'cross the bridge of good, lies a beautiful life.
\
\
We can't change people

But we can change people

Help and inspire.
\
\
We all are mere caterpillars, meant to flourish

To become the beauties of nature,

Butterflies.
