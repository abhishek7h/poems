Some things just seem hard, even before I try it, it just seems so hard it makes me want to quit. But, what's the fun in that? However hard it might be, I try to do it, and when I do it, it would turn out to be easy.

That's exactly a mindset one needs. It's very common to encounter such problems. Quitting is the easiest thing to do. But it's not worth it. Quitting without even trying? You have to try it and work to your maximum potential before the thought of quitting even comes to your mind. It's hard. Quitting might be the first thing that comes up when something seems hard. Try it, it might be very easy. You might be panicking for nothing.

Life itself is hard, and that's why many people decide to quit life. More than 800,000 people, to be exact. It's just heartbreaking, just deciding to end your precious life. The concept hurts me. My advice is to never quit life. It's not worth it.

But it's when you try, succeed and achieve what you've always dreamt of, that feeling is out of this world, and you think it was worth it not quitting. The same is when people discouraged you, made fun of you, didn't believe in you, told you you couldn't do it, told you were nothing, the feeling when you defy them and show them who you are, that feeling is out of this universe.
