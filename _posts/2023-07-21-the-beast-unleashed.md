title: The Beast Unleashed
---

I unleash the power, that I've stored for long,

Gathered from my haters, who didn't believe in me,

Who made fun of me and hurt me,

I use that very hate and convert it to power,

To unleash the beast inside of me.

It helped me learn the art of self-control,

It helped me learn how to love myself,

And it helped me learn kindness,

Hate is strong, and I experienced it,

All because of certain people, whom I thank.
\
\
For I could unleash the beast within,
Whose existence I did not know of,

I felt it trembling, an extreme power,

It freed itself, and showed me success,

From hate, I found love.

I found power, I became stronger,

I became my best self, better than ever.

The power, ebbing and flowing,

It was there when I needed it, else not,

All because of certain people, whom I thank.
