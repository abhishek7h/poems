I’m Abhishek. I live in Kerala, India. I like programming, writing, anime, reading, music, gaming and playing football. I’m currently a student with interest in law. I like Social Science and English, and I am planning to major in humanities. I’m crazy about tech, especially smartphones. I currently daily-drive a Galaxy A34 5G and a Lenovo ideapad Slim 5. I’ve also taught myself Python and took a game-dev course in JavaScript. I prefer coding in Python but I do enjoy vanilla web development. I’m trying to learn React to develop better apps.
